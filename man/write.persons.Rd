\usage{
write.persons(x, chem, set, specs)
}
\description{
This function writes demographic, exposure, and dose variables to a separate output file for each chemical.
}
\details{
THis function rounds the variables to a reasonable precision so that the files are more readable, as unrounded
output is cluttered with entries with (say) 14 digits, most of which are not significant.
