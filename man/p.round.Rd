\usage{
p.round(x = NULL, q = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Required     Default = none}

\item{q}{Optional    Default = none}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as the input "x", containing all integer values.
}
\description{
p.round performs stochastic or probabilistic rounding of non-integer values.
}
\details{
The input "x" is a vector of values to be rounded.  Each value of x is rounded independently, either up or down.
The fractional value of x is used to determine weights for rounding in each direction.  For example, if x=4.3, then it is
rounded up to 5 with probability 0.3, else rounded down to 4 (with probability 0.7).   The p.round function always returns
integer values, and does not introduce bias.  In the above example, if the argument were 4.3 a large number of times, then
the returned values (all either 4 or 5) would average 4.3 with a small residual error which approaches zero as "n" gets large.
