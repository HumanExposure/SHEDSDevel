Package: ShedsHT
Title: The SHEDS-HT model for estimating human
        exposure to chemicals.
Version: 0.1.8
Author: Kristin Isaacs [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Kristin Isaacs <isaacs.kristin@epa.gov>
Description: The ShedsHT R package runs the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose
    Simulation-High Throughput screening model which estmates human exposure to a
    wide range of chemicals.The people in SHEDS-HT are simulated individuals who
    collectively form a representative sample of the target population, as chosen by
    the user. The model is cross-sectional, with just one simulated day (24 hours)
    for each simulated person, although the selected day is not necessarily the same
    from one person to another. SHEDS-HT is stochastic, which means that many inputs
    are sampled randomly from user-specified distributions that are intended to
    capture variability. In the SHEDS series of models, variability and uncertainty
    are typically handled by a two-stage Monte Carlo process, but SHEDS-HT currently
    has a single stage and does not directly estimate uncertainty.

# `act.diary.pools`: act.diary.pools

## Description


 Assigns activity diaries from the [`Activity_diaries`](Activity_diaries.html) input on the [`Run`](Run.html) file
 (read through the [`read.act.diaries`](read.act.diaries.html) function) to pools based on age, gender, and season


## Usage

```r
act.diary.pools(diaries, specs)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```diaries```     |     A data set created internally in SHEDS.HT through the [`read.act.diaries`](read.act.diaries.html) function. The data are activity diaries, which indicate the amount of time and level of metabolic activity in various micro environments. Each line of data represents one person-day (24 hours).
```specs```     |     Output of the [`read.run.file`](read.run.file.html) function, which can be modified by the [`update.specs`](update.specs.html)  function before input into `act.diary.pools` .

## Details


 The `act.diary.pools` function assigns the activity diaries to pools. A given diary may belong to
 many pools, since every year of age has its own pool. Large pools may contain a list of several hundred diary numbers.
 The code contains four loops and on each step performs a sub-setting of the list of diary numbers.


## Value


 pool A vector of lists.  The length of `pool` is the product of the genders, seasons, and ages inputs specified
 in the [`Run`](Run.html) file. Each element is a list of acceptable activity diary numbers for each year of age, gender,
 weekend, and season combination. For example, `pool` [100] may have the name M0P99, which indicates that it is for
 males, on weekdays, in spring,for age=99.
 In addition, If the function runs successfully, the following message will be printed:
 "Activity Diary Pooling completed"


## Seealso


 [`run`](run.html) 


## Note


 The input to `act.diary.pools` , diaries, is created by reading in the Activity_diaries input file (specified on
 the [`Run`](Run.html) file) with the [`read.act.diaries`](read.act.diaries.html) function within the [`run`](run.html) function.

# `add.factors`: add.factors
 Adds specific exposure factors to the `pdm` data table, which is output from the [`add.media`](add.media.html) function. Here,
 "specific" means taking into account the age, gender, season, and exposure media for each person.

## Description


 add.factors
 Adds specific exposure factors to the `pdm` data table, which is output from the [`add.media`](add.media.html) function. Here,
 "specific" means taking into account the age, gender, season, and exposure media for each person.


## Usage

```r
add.factors(n, gen.f, med.f, exp.f, surf, pdm)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```n```     |     Number of persons
```gen.f```     |     Non-media specific exposure factors as a data table. Output from the [`gen.factor.tables`](gen.factor.tables.html) function.
```med.f```     |     Media specific exposure factors presented as a data table. Output from the [`med.factor.tables`](med.factor.tables.html) function.
```exp.f```     |     Distributional parameters for the exposure factors. Output of the [`exp.factors`](exp.factors.html) function.
```surf```     |     A list of surface media. Modified output of the [`read.media.file`](read.media.file.html) function.
```pdm```     |     A data table containing the `pd` data frame of physiological and demographic parameters for each theoretical person, and the `dur` array, which specifies the duration of exposure to each potential exposure medium for each person in `pd` . Output of the [`add.media`](add.media.html) function.

## Details


 The process of adding specific exposure factors to `pdm` involves multiple steps. First, `w` is determined,
 which is the number of general factors plus the product of the number of media-specific factors and the number of surface media.
 Air media do not have media specific factors in this version of SHEDS. An array, `q` , of uniform random samples is
 generated, with one row per person and `w` columns.  A zero matrix, `r` , of the same size is defined.
 Once these matrices are defined, the media-specific factors are determined. Two nested loops over variable and surface type
 generate the values, which are stored in `r` . Next, another FOR loop determines the general factors. The `p` data set
 contains the age, gender, and season for each person. These two data sets are then merged. The evaluation of these factors is
 handled by the [`eval.factors`](eval.factors.html) function.
 One of the exposure factors is `handwash.freq` . This was also part of SHEDS-Multimedia, where it represented the mean
 number of hours in the day with hand washing events. An important aspect of that model was that because each person was followed
 longitudinally, the actual number of hand washes on each day varied from one day to the next. Because of this, the distribution
 for `handwash.freq` did not need to be restricted to integer values, as (for example) a mean of 4.5 per day is acceptable
 and achievable, while choosing integer numbers of hand washes each day.  One of the early goals with SHEDS.HT was to attempt
 to reproduce selected results from SHEDS-Multimedia. Therefore, similar logic was built into the current model. The
 `hand.washes` variable is sampled from a distribution centered on `handwash.freq` , and then rounded to the nearest
 integer.
 The `bath` variable is another difficult concept. In theory, baths and showers are recorded on the activity diaries.
 In practice, the activity diaries were constructed from approximately 20 separate studies, some of which did not contain enough
 detail to identify separate bath or shower events. The result is that about half of all diaries record such events, but the
 true rate in the population is higher. The `bath.p` variable was created to address this. It represents the  probability
 that a non bath/shower activity diary should actually have one. Therefore, if the diary has one, then SHEDS automatically has
 one. Otherwise, a binomial sample using `bath.p` as the probability is drawn. A bath/shower occurs unless both of these
 are zero.
 The effectiveness of hand washes or bath/shower at removing chemical from the skin is determined in the
 [`post.exposure`](post.exposure.html) function.


## Value


 pdmf A data set containing the `pdm` data table as well as media specific exposure factors, the number of baths
 taken, and the number of hand wash events occurring per day per person contained in `pdm` .

# `add.fugs`: add.fugs

## Description


 Evaluates the variables in the fugacity input file and creates values for those variables corresponding to each simulated person.


## Usage

```r
add.fugs(n.per, x, pdmf)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```n.per```     |     The total number of simulated persons in this model run specified in the [`Run`](Run.html) file
```x```     |     the output of the [`read.fug.inputs`](read.fug.inputs.html) function.
```pdmf```     |     he output of the [`add.factors`](add.factors.html) function. A data set containing physiological and demographic parameters for each theoretical person, the duration of exposure to each potential exposure medium for each person, the media specific exposure factors, and the  number of baths taken and hand wash events occurring per day for each person.

## Details


 This function evaluates the variables in the fugacity input file, creating one value for each simulated
 person and adding each variable as a new column in the pdmf data set (renamed as pdmff). All variables are left i
 n their original units except for those with units ug/cm2, which are converted to ug/m2. In the fugacity calculations,
 all masses are in ug and all lengths are in m.


## Value


 pdmff Output contains values sampled from the distributions of each relevant variable in the [`Fugacity`](Fugacity.html) 
 input file for each theoretical person.

# `add.media`: add.media

## Description


 For each theoretical person parameterized in the `pd` data frame, which is output from the [`select.people`](select.people.html) 
 function, this function generates the exposure duration for each potential exposure medium.


## Usage

```r
add.media(n, media, pd)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```n```     |     Number of persons.
```media```     |     List of the potential contact media for the model; output of the [`read.media.file`](read.media.file.html) function. Each is found in a specific microenvironment (micro).
```pd```     |     Data frame containing internally assigned demographic and physiological parameters for each theoretical person modeled in SHEDS.HT. Output of the [`select.people`](select.people.html) function

## Details


 To generate the exposure duration for each theoretical person, an array q of uniform random samples is generated with
 rows = `n` (per set, where set size is specified by the user in the [`Run`](Run.html) input file) and columns =
 `nrow(media)` (the number of potential exposure media). An array called `dur` is created for the number of minutes on
 the activity diary in the relevant micro multiplied by the relevant probability of contact (as specified in the
 `media` input). The array consists of a row for each person and a column for each of the exposure media.  The output is a
 data table containing the `pd` data frame and the `dur` array.


## Value


 pdm A data table containing the `pd` data frame of physiological and demographic parameters for each theoretical
 person, and the `dur` array, which specifies the duration of exposure to each potential exposure medium for each person
 in `pd` .

## Description


 check.foods
 
 This function creates a list of unique food types.


## Usage

```r
check.foods(s)
```


# `check.src.scen.flags`: check.src.scen.flags

## Description


 This function checks whether the settings on the source.scen object (input as "df") are set to numeric values of 1 or 0.  If the column for a particular exposure scenario is missing from "df", it is created and assigned "0" for all sources.


## Usage

```r
check.src.scen.flags(df)
```


# `check.src.scen.types`: Check.src.scen.types

## Description


 This function checks whether the settings on the source.scen object (input as "df") are consistent with the source.type for each source.


## Usage

```r
check.src.scen.types(df)
```


# `chem.fug`: chem.fug

## Description


 Creates distributions of chemical specific parameters for each chemical of interest, in order to reflect real-world
 variability and uncertainty. These distributions are then sampled to create chemical specific parameters associated
 with the exposure of each simulated person.


## Usage

```r
chem.fug(n.per, cprops, x)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```n.per```     |     The total number of simulated persons in this model run specified in the [`Run`](Run.html) file.
```cprops```     |     The chemical properties required for SHEDS-HT (output of `chem.props` function). The default data was prepared from publicly available databases using a custom program (not part of SHEDS-HT). The default file contains about 17 numerical inputs per chemical, but most are not used. The required properties are molecular weight ( `MW` ), vapor pressure ( `VP.Pa` ), solubility ( `water.sol.mg.l` ), octanol-water partition coefficient ( `log.Kow` ), air decay rate ( `half.air.hr` ), decay rate on surfaces ( `half.sediment.hr` ), and permeability coefficient ( `Kp` ).
```x```     |     From the output of the [`read.fug.inputs`](read.fug.inputs.html) function.

## Details


 This function obtains chemical-specific properties from the chem.data data set.That data set contains
 point value for each variable, which this function defines distributions around, with the exception of molecular
 weight. The constructed distributions reflect both uncertainty and variability (for example, vapor pressure will
 vary with temperature, humidity, and air pressure or altitude, and may depend on the product formulation).
 For each variable, a random sample is generated for each simulated person, and the set of variables becomes the
 output data set.
 Input surface loading variables are in units of ug/cm2 or ug/cm2/day and are converted by the function to meters,
 to avoid the need for conversion factors in later equations. These conversions are done after the random sampling,
 as otherwise the correct conversions depend on the distributional form (for example, par2 is changed for the normal,
 but not for the lognormal).


## Value


 samples A data set with the chemical specific parameters for each combination of chemical and simulated person.
 For each chemical, the chemical specific parameters assigned to a given person are randomly sampled from distributions
 on those parameters. These distributions are created from point estimates to reflect real-world uncertainty and variability.

# `combine_output`: combine_output

## Description


 combine_output is a post-processing tool that extracts selected statistics (those specified in the 'metrics' argument)
 from the 'allstats' file for each chemical in a single model run, and combines them onto out.file.


## Usage

```r
combine_output(run.name = specs$run.name, out.file = "SHEDSOutFCS.csv",
  metrics = c("5%", "50%", "75%", "95%", "99%", "mean", "sd"))
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------

 exposure or dose metrics across chemicals, use combine_output to put the relevant information for all chemicals together
 on one file.


## Value


 finaldata A R object that has "exp.dermal", "exp.ingest", m"exp.inhal", "dose.inhal", "dose.intake", "abs.dermal.ug",
 "abs.ingest.ug", "abs.inhal.ug", "abs.tot.ug", "abs.tot.mgkg", "ddd.mass" for the chemcial of question. This is tablated for
 the "5%", "50%", "75%", "95%", "99%", quantile of exposure as well as the mean and sd

# `create.scen.factors`: create.scen.factors

## Description


 This function takes the information on distributions from the `all.scenarios` data set (which comes from
 the [`source_variables_12112015`](source_variables_12112015.html) input file) and converts it into the parameter set needed by SHEDS.HT.


## Usage

```r
create.scen.factors(f)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```f```     |     An internally generated data set from the [`Source_vars`](Source_vars.html) input file (as specified in the [`Run`](Run.html)  file) containing data on the distribution of each source variable in SHEDS.HT.

## Details


 The steps involved in this function are 1) converting `prevalence` from a percentage to a binomial form, 2)
 converting `CV` to standard deviation for normals, and 3) converting `Mean` and `CV` to par1 and par2 for
 lognormals.
 Note that `prevalence` in SHEDS becomes a binomial distribution, which returns a value of either 0 or 1 when evaluated.
 Each simulated person either "does" or "does not" partake in this scenario. Similar logic applies to the `frequency` 
 variable, except that the returned values may be larger than one (that is, 2 or more) for very frequent scenarios.  All the
 exposure equations contain the `prevalence` variable. If `prevalence` is set to one for that person, the exposure
 is as expected, but if `prevalence` =0 then no exposure occurs.


## Value


 dt A data set with values and probabilities associated with each variable distribution presented in `f` .
 All variables in `f` are also retained.

# `diet.diary.pools`: diet.diary.pools

## Description


 Assigns activity diaries from the [`Diet_diaries`](Diet_diaries.html) input on the [`Run`](Run.html) file
 (read through the [`read.run.file`](read.run.file.html) function) to pools based on age and gender.


## Usage

```r
diet.diary.pools(diaries, specs)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```specs```     |     Output of the [`read.run.file`](read.run.file.html) function, which can be modified by the [`update.specs`](update.specs.html)  function before input into `diet.diary.pools` .
```diet.diaries```     |     A data set created internally in SHEDS.HT through the [`read.diet.diaries`](read.diet.diaries.html) function. The data are daily diaries of dietary consumption by food group. Each line represents one person-day, with demographic variables followed by amounts (in grams/day) for a list of food types indicated by a short abbreviation on the header line.

## Details


 The `diet.diary.pools` function assigns the dietary diaries to pools. A given diary may belong to many pools,
 since every year of age has its own pool. Large pools may contain a list of several hundred diary numbers. The code contains
 four loops and on each step performs a sub-setting of the list of diary numbers.


## Value


 dpool A vector of lists.  The length of `dpool` is the product of the gender  and age inputs specified in
 the [`Run`](Run.html) file. Each element is a list of acceptable diet diary numbers for each year of age and each gender
 combination.
 In addition, if the function runs successfully, the following message will be printed: "Dietary Diary Pooling completed"

# `dir.dermal`: dir.dermal

## Description


 Models the dermal exposure scenario for each theoretical person.


## Usage

```r
dir.dermal(sd, cd)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sd```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```cd```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.

## Details


 The dermal exposure scenario is relatively straightforward. The function produces a prevalence value, which reflects
 the fraction of the population who use this scenario at all. It also produces a frequency value, which is the mean number of
 times per year this scenario occurs among that fraction of the population specified by prevalence.
 Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the frequency is  divided by 365 and then passed to the
 [`p.round`](p.round.html) (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very common
 events may happen more than once in a day.
 The function also produces a mass variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical usage event.
 The composition is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question.
 The resid variable measures the fraction that is likely to remain on the skin when the usage event ends.
 The final output is the total dermal exposure for each chemical-individual combination in micrograms, which is the product of
 the above variables multiplied by a factor of 1E+06.


## Value


 dir.derm  For each person, the calculated direct dermal exposure that occurs when a chemical-containing product
 is used. This does not include later contact with treated objects, which is indirect exposure.

# `dir.ingested`: dir.ingested

## Description


 Models the ingestion exposure scenario for each theoretical person.


## Usage

```r
dir.ingested(sd, cd)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sd```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```cd```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.

## Details


 This scenario is for accidental ingestion during product usage. Typical examples are toothpaste, mouthwash,
 lipstick or chap stick, and similar products used on the face or mouth.
 The function produces a `prevalence` value, which reflects the fraction of the population who use this scenario at all.
 It also produces a `frequency` value, which is the mean number  of times per year this scenario occurs among that
 fraction of the population specified by prevalence.
 Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the frequency is  divided by 365 and then passed to the
 [`p.round`](p.round.html) (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very common
 events may happen more than once in a day.
 The function also produces a `mass` variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical usage event.
 The `composition` is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question.
 The `ingested` variable represents the percentage of the mass applied that becomes ingested. Since these products are
 not intended to be swallowed, this should typically be quite small (under 5%).
 The final output is the total incidental ingested exposure for each chemical-individual combination in micrograms, which
 is the product of the above variables multiplied by a factor of 1E6.


## Value


 dir.ingest For each person, the calculated quantity of a given chemical incidentally ingested during or
 immediately after use of products such as toothpaste. Does not include exposure via food and drinking water.

# `dir.inhal.aer`: dir.inhal.aer

## Description


 Models the inhalation exposure from the use of aerosol products for each theoretical person.


## Usage

```r
dir.inhal.aer(sd, cd, cb, io)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sd```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```cd```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.
```cb```     |     A copy of the `base` data set output from the [`make.cbase`](make.cbase.html) function, with columns added for exposure variables.
```io```     |     A binary variable indicating whether the volume of the aerosol is used to approximate the affected volume.

## Details


 This scenario considers inhalation exposure from the use of aerosol products. Typical examples include hairspray
 and spray-on mosquito repellent.
 The function produces a `prevalence` value, which reflects the fraction of the population who use this scenario at all.
 It also produces a `frequency` value, which is the mean number  of times per year this scenario occurs among that
 fraction of the population specified by prevalence.
 Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the `frequency` is  divided by 365 and then passed to
 the [`p.round`](p.round.html) (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very
 common events may happen more than once in a day.
 The function also produces a `mass` variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical usage
 event. The `composition` is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question.
 `frac.aer` is the fraction of the product mass that becomes aerosolized, and the `volume` affected by the use is
 approximated to allow the calculation of a concentration or density. Defaults are set in the code if these variables  are
 missing from the input file.
 Exposure for the inhalation pathway has units of micrograms per cubic meter, reflecting the average air concentration of
 the chemical. An `airconc` variable is defined using `mass` , `composition` , `frac.aer` , and `volume` .
 Since exposure depends on the time-averaged concentration, a duration is necessary. For example, if one spends five minutes
 in an aerosol cloud and the rest of the day in clean air, the daily exposure is the cloud concentration multiplied by 5/1440
 (where 1440 is the number of minutes in a day).
 This function also calculates the inhaled dose, in units of micrograms per day. The dose equals the product of
 `exposure` (g/m3), basal ventilation rate, `bvr` (m3/day), the METS factor of 1.75 (typically people inhale air
 at an average of 1.75 times the basal rate to support common daily activities), and a  conversion factor of 1E+06 from grams
 to micrograms.


## Value


 dir.inh.aer The calculated quantity of chemical inhalation from aerosols, like hairspray and similar products,
 that are directly injected into the air on or around each exposed person.

The default file (the [`Chem_props file`](Chem_props file.html) read in by the [`read.chem.props`](read.chem.props.html) function and modified before input into the current function) was prepared from publicly available databases using a custom program (not part of SHEDS-HT).  The default file contains 7 numerical inputs per chemical, and the required properties are molecular weight ( `MW` ), vapor pressure ( `VP.Pa` ), solubility ( `water.sol.mg.l` ), octanol-water partition coefficient ( `log.Kow` ), air decay rate ( `half.air.hr` ), decay rate on surfaces ( `half.sediment.hr` ), and permeability coefficient ( `Kp` ).
```cb```     |     A copy of the `base` data set output from the [`make.cbase`](make.cbase.html) function, with columns added for exposure variables.
```io```     |     A binary variable indicating whether the volume of the aerosol is used to approximate the affected volume.

## Details


 This scenario considers inhalation exposure from vapors (not aerosols). For example, painting will result in the
 inhalation of vapor, but it does not involve aerosols (unless it is spray paint).
 For this scenario, the vapor pressure and the molecular weight are relevant variables for determining exposure. These
 variables are included in the input to the `cprops` argument, which is drawn internally from the
 [`Chem_props`](Chem_props.html) file.
 The function produces a `prevalence` value, which reflects the fraction of the population who use this scenario at
 all. It also produces a `frequency` value, which is the mean number of times per year this scenario occurs among that
 fraction of the population specified by `prevalence` .
 Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the `frequency` is  divided by 365 and then passed to the
 [`p.round`](p.round.html) (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very
 common events may happen more than once in a day.
 The function also produces a `mass` variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical usage
 event. The `composition` is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question. The `evap` variable is
 an effective evaporated mass, calculated using the `mass` , `composition` (converted from percent to a fraction),
 the vapor pressure as a surrogate for partial pressure, and `duration` of product use.  The `duration` term is
 made unitless by dividing by 5 (minutes), which is an assumed time constant.
 The effective air concentation `airconc` is calculated as `evap` / `volume` . The value for `airconce` 
 is capped by `maxconc` , which represents the point at which evaporation ceases.  For chemicals used for a short
 duration, or with low vapor presssure, `maxconc` might not be reached before usage stops.
 Once `airconc` is established, the function also calculates the inhaled dose, in units of micrograms per day.
 The dose equals the product of `exposure` (g/m3), basal ventilation rate, `bvr` (m3/day), the METS factor of 1.75
 (typically people inhale air at an average of 1.75 times the basal rate to support common daily activities), and a
 conversion factor of 1E6 from grams to micrograms.

# `distrib`: distrib

## Description


 produces random samples from distributuions


## Usage

```r
distrib(shape = "", par1 = NA, par2 = NA, par3 = NA, par4 = NA,
  lt = NA, ut = NA, resamp = "y", n = 1, q = NA, p = c(1),
  v = "")
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```shape```     |     Required with no default. The permited inputs are Bernoulli, binomial, beta, discrete, empirical, exponential, gamma, lognormal, normal, point, probability, triangle, uniform, and Weibull.
```par1```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = none
```par2```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = none
```par3```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = none
```par4```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = none
```resamp```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = 'y'
```n```     |     Optional    Default = 1
```q```     |     Optional    Default = none
```p```     |     Optional    Default = c(1)
```v```     |     Optional    Default = none
```It```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = none
```Ut```     |     optional value requared for some shapes. Defulat = none

## Details


 This process is central to SHEDS because it is a stochastic model.  The "shape" is the essential argument,
 with others being required for certain shapes.  For all shapes, one of  "n" or "q" must be specified.  If "n" is given,
 then Distrib returns a vector of "n" independent random samples from the specified distribution.  If "q" is given, it
 must be a vector of numeric values, each between zero and one.  These are interpreted as the quantiles of the distribution
 to be returned.  When "q" is given, Distrib does not generate any random values, it just evaluates the requested quantiles.
 The empirical shape requires argument "v" as a list of possible values to be returned, each with equal probability.
 The other shapes require one or more of par1-par4 to be specified.  See the SHEDS Technical Manual for more details on the
 meanings of par1-par4, which vary by shape.  "Lower.trun" is the lower truncation point, meaning the smallest value that can
 be returned.  Similarly, "upper.trun" is the largest value that may be returned.  Not all distributions use lower.trun and/or
 upper.trun, but they should be specified for unbounded shapes like the Normal distribution.  "Resamp" is a flag to indicate
 the resolution for generated values outside the truncation limits.  If resamp="yes" then effectively new values are generated
 until they are within the limits.  If resamp="no", values outside the limits are moved to those limits.  "P" is a list of
 probabilities that are used only with the "discrete" or "probability" shapes.  The "p" values are essentially weights for a
 list of discrete values that may be returned.  The "empirical" distribution also returns discrete values, but assigns them
 equal weights, so then "p" is not needed.


## Value


 A vector of "n" values from one distribution, where "n" is
 either the input argument (if given), or the length of the input vector "q".

# `down.the.drain.mass`: down.the.drain.mass

## Description


 Models the quantity of chemical entering the waste water system on a per person-day basis.


## Usage

```r
down.the.drain.mass(sd, cd)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sd```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```cd```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.

## Details


 This function models the simplest of all the current scenarios. It evaluates the amount of chemical entering
 the waste water system, on a per person-day basis.  The "exposure" is to a system, not a person, but this method uses
 one person's actions to estimate their contribution to the total.
 The function produces a `prevalence` value, which reflects the fraction of the population who use this scenario at
 all. It also produces a `frequency` value, which is the mean number  of times per year this scenario occurs among
 that fraction of the population specified by prevalence.
 Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the `frequency` is  divided by 365 and then passed to the
 [`p.round`](p.round.html) (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very
 common events may happen more than once in a day.
 The function also produces a `mass` variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical
 usage event. The `composition` is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question.
 The final output, `exp.ddd.mass` , is the product of the `prevalence` , `frequency` , `mass` ,
 `composition` , and the fraction going down the drain ( `f.drain` , a variable in the `sd` input).
 The result is in grams per person-day.


## Value


 exp.ddd.mass The calculated quantity of chemical going down the drain (i.e., from laundry detergent) and
 entering the sewer system per person per day.

# `filter_sources`: filter_sources

## Description


 This function is used to select a subset of sources from another "source" file.


## Usage

```r
filter_sources(in.file = "source_scen_prods.csv",
  out.file = "source_scen_subset.csv", ids = c("ALL"),
  types = c("ALL"))
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```In.file```     |     a csv file that contains expsoure info default = "source_scen_prods.csv"
```Out.file```     |     default = "source_scen_prods.csv"
```IDS```     |     default = "ALL"
```Types```     |     default = "ALL"

## Details


 This function is used to select a subset of sources from another "source" file.  This is achieved by specifying
 either a list of the desired source ids, or one or more sources types.  The allowed types are "A" for articles, "F" for
 foods, or "P" for products.  Use the c() function to list more than one item (e.g. types=c("F","P") for foods and products).
 Any of the three types of source files (that is, source_scen, source_chem, or source_vars) may be used.
 Specifying specific sources is achieved using the "ids" argument.  This may require examining the in.file beforehand,
 to obtain the correct source.id values for the desired sources.


## Value


 A .csv file of the same type as in.file, with the same variables and data, but fewer rows. The selected rows
 have source.type matching one of the elements in the "types" argument, and also have source.id matching one of the
 elements of the "ids" argument.  If either argument is missing, then all sources automatically match it.  Filter_sources
 also returns an R object containing the same data as the output .csv file.


# `food.migration`: food.migration

## Description

 establish a total exposure from the dietary pathway.


## Usage

```r
food.migration(cdata, sdata, cb, ftype)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```cdata```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.
```sdata```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.

```ftype```     |     Food consumption database which stores data on consumption in grams per day of each food type for each person being modeled. Generated internally from the [`Diet_diaries`](Diet_diaries.html) data set.

## Details


 If migration data is stored in the `cdata` argument, this is added to the total exposure calculated in the
 [`food.residue`](food.residue.html) function.


## Value


 dietary The calculated quantity of chemical exposure from food residue and migration of chemicals into food from
 packaging and other contact materials in grams per person per day.

# `food.residue`: food.residue

## Description


 Models exposure to chemicals from consumption of food containing a known chemical residue for each theoretical person.


## Usage

```r
food.residue(cdata, cb, ftype)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```cdata```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.
```cb```     |     Output of the [`make.cbase`](make.cbase.html) function.
```ftype```     |     Food consumption database which stores data on consumption in grams per day of each food type for each person being modeled. Generated internally from the [`Diet_diaries`](Diet_diaries.html) data set.

## Details


 In this function, the variable `foods` is defined as a list of the names of the food groups,
 which are stored in both the `ftype` and `cb` arguments. The FOR loop picks the name of each food group as
 a string, and converts it to a variable name. For example, the food group "FV" may have corresponding variables
 `residue.FV` , `zeros.FV` (number of nondetects), and `nonzeros.FV` (number of detects) on the `cb` 
 data set. If these variables are not present, no  exposure results.  The variables may be present, but an individual
 person may still receive zero exposure because  not all samples of that food are contaminated, as indicated by the
 `zeros.FV` value.  The `nonzeros.FV` value is used to  determine the likelihood of contamination, with the
 residue variable determining the amount found (when it is nonzero).
 The dietary exposure is the product of the `consumption` as reported in the `ftypes` input (in grams) and
 the `residue.FV` (in micrograms of chemical per gram of food), summed over all food groups. Three other vectors are
 returned (corresponding to dermal exposure, inhalation exposure, and inhalation dose), but these are currently set to zero
 for the dietary pathway. In principle, eating food could result in dermal exposure (for finger foods), or inhalation (as
 foods may have noticeable odors), but such exposures are not large enough to be of concern at present.


## Value


 dietary The calculated quantity of chemical exposure from food residue in grams per person per day.

# `gen.factor.tables`: gen.factor.tables

## Description


 Constructs tables of non-media specific exposure factors for each relevant combination of age, gender, and season. The
 input is from the [`Exp_actors`](Exp_actors.html) file (specified on the [`Run`](Run.html) file) after being read through the
 [`read.exp.factors`](read.exp.factors.html) function.


## Usage

```r
gen.factor.tables(ef = exp.factors)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```ef```     |     A data set created internally using the [`run`](run.html) function and the [`read.exp.factors`](read.exp.factors.html)  function to import the user specified [`Exp_factors`](Exp_factors.html) input file. The data set contains the distributional parameters for the exposure factors. All of these variables may have age or gender-dependent distributions, although in the absence of data, many are assigned a single distribution from which all persons are sampled.

## Value


 exp.gen Output consists of non-media specific exposure factors as a data table. Depending on the user input,
 these generated exposure factors may be gender and/or season specific.  Each gender-season combination is assigned
 a row number pointing to the appropriate distribution on the output dataset from the [`read.exp.factors`](read.exp.factors.html) function.
 Thus, `exp.gen` consists of 8 rows per variable (2 genders x 4 seasons), regardless of the number of different
 distributions used for that variable.
 In addition, if the function runs successfully, the following message is printed: "General Factor Tables completed"

# `get.fug.concs`: get.fug.concs

## Description


 Performs fugacity calculations to evaluate time-dependent chemical flows.


## Usage

```r
get.fug.concs(sdata, chem.data, x, cfug)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sdata```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```chem.data```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.
```x```     |     The output of the [`add.fugs`](add.fugs.html) function.
```cfug```     |     The output of the [`chem_fug`](chem_fug.html) function, a data set with the chemical specific parameters for each combination of chemical and simulated person. For each chemical, the chemical specific parameters assigned to a given person are randomly sampled from distributions on those parameters. These distributions are created from point estimates to reflect real-world uncertainty and variability.

## Details


 This is one of two functions that perform fugacity calculations. This one evaluates dynamic or time-dependent chemical
 First, a set of local variables are determined for use in later calculations.  These are a mix of fixed and chemical-dependent
 variables (evaluated separately for each person).  Some variables, like chemical mass and app.rates, vary with each source, so
 these calculations are repeated for each source-scenario.
 Second, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix are calculated.  Since the fugacity model has been reduced to
 just two compartments (air and surface), the solutions can be expressed analytically, and there is no explicit invocation of
 any linear algebra routines that would normally be required.
 Third, the variables composing the `concs` output are evaluated. The variables `m.c.air` and `m.c.sur` 
 are the time-constant masses, while `m.t0.air` and `m.t0.sur` are the time-dependent masses at t=0. The
 time-constant parts are zero here because the permanent sources (i.e. `c.src.air` and `c.src.sur` ) are
 assumed to be zero in these calculations.  The time-dependent masses are multiplied exponentially as a function of time,
 and thus approach zero when enough time has passed.


## Value


 concs A data set containing calculated dynamic chemical flows for each unique combination
 of simulated person and chemical.

# `get.y0.concs`: get.y0.concs

## Description


 Performs fugacity calculations to evaluate constant (time-independent) chemical flows, such as emissions from household articles.


## Usage

```r
get.y0.concs(sdata, chem.data, pdmff, cfug)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sdata```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```chem.data```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.
```pdmff```     |     Output from the [`add.fugs`](add.fugs.html) function. A data set containing values sampled from the distributions of each relevant variable in the [`Fugacity`](Fugacity.html) input file for each theoretical person.
```cfug```     |     The output of the [`chem_fug`](chem_fug.html) function, a data set with the chemical specific parameters for each combination of chemical and simulated person. For each chemical, the chemical specific parameters assigned to a given person are randomly sampled from distributions on those parameters. These distributions are created from point estimates to reflect real-world uncertainty and variability.

## Details


 This function evaluates the chemical concentrations resulting from constant source emissions. Thus, the
 function employs the steady state solution to the fugacity equations. The basis for these calculations is that the
 chemical sources are from articles, and are thus permanent and unchanging. The chemical concentrations will therefore
 quickly adjust so that the flows are balanced, and the concentrations remain fixed thereafter.


## Value


 concs A data set containing calculated steady state chemical flows for each unique combination of simulated
 person and chemical.

# `indir.exposure`: indir.exposure

## Description


 Models the indirect exposure to chemicals in the home for each theoretical person.


## Usage

```r
indir.exposure(sd, cb, concs, chem.data)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```sd```     |     The chemical-scenario data specific to relevant combinations of chemical and scenario. Generated internally.
```cb```     |     A copy of the `base` data set output from the [`make.cbase`](make.cbase.html) function, with columns added for exposure variables.
```concs```     |     The concentration of the chemical (in air and/or on surfaces) being released into the environment. Outpu of the [`get.fug.concs`](get.fug.concs.html) function.
```chem.data```     |     The list of scenario-specific information for the chemicals being evaluated. Generated internally.

## Details


 Indirect exposure happens after a product is no longer being used or applied, due to chemical lingering on various
 surfaces or in the air. People who come along later may receive dermal or inhalation exposure from residual chemical in the
 environment.
 SHEDS.HT currently has two indirect exposure scenarios. One which applies to a one-time chemical treatment applied to a
 house, and another which applies to continual releases from articles. Both scenarios consist of two parts: the first
 determines the appropriate air and surface concentrations. That code is in the [`Fugacity`](Fugacity.html) module.  The second
 part is the exposure calculation by the current function. Both types of indirect exposure scenarios call this function.
 The surface and air concentrations from the [`Fugacity`](Fugacity.html) module are premised on the product use actually occurring.
 Hence, [`indir.exposure`](indir.exposure.html) starts by multiplying those concentrations by the `prevalence` (which is either 0
 or 1, evaluated separately for each person).
 For air, the exposure is the average daily concentration, which is the event concentration multiplied by the fraction of
 the day spent in that event. The inhaled dose is the product of the exposure, the basal ventilation rate, and the PAI factor
 (multiplier for the basal rate). A factor of 1E+06 converts the result from grams per day to micrograms per day.
 Dermal exposure results from skin contact with surfaces. The surface concentration (ug/cm2) is multiplied by the
 fraction available for transfer ( `avail.f` , unitless), the transfer coefficient ( `dermal.tc` , in cm2/hr), and the
 contact `duration` (hr/day).  The result is the amount of chemical transferred onto the skin (ug/day).


## Value


 indir Indirect exposure to chemicals in the home in ug per person per day.

```ef```     |     A data set created internally using the [`run`](run.html) function and the [`read.exp.factors`](read.exp.factors.html) function to import the user specified [`Exp_factors`](Exp_factors.html) input file. The data set contains the distributional parameters for the exposure factors. All of these variables may have age or gender-dependent distributions, although in the absence of data, many are assigned a single distribution from which all persons are sampled.
```media.sur```     |     A list of surface media. This data set is created internally by sub-setting the [`Media`](Media.html) input file (read in with the [`read.media.file`](read.media.file.html) function within the [`run`](run.html) function) to extract only surface media.

## Value


 exp.med Media specific exposure factors presented as a data table. The present version of the model consists of only
 3 such exposure factors, but the code will accept more. Depending on the user input, these generated exposure factors may be
 gender and/or season specific in addition to media specific. The output consists of 24 rows per variable (2 genders x 4
 seasons x 3 media), when all ages share the same distribution. If a variable has N age categories (each with its own
 distribution) then there are (24 x N) rows for that variable.
 In addition, if the function runs successfully, the following message is printed: "Media-specific Factor Tables completed"

## Note


 The first input argument to `med.factor.tables` (ef) is created by reading in the [`Exp_factors`](Exp_factors.html) 
 input file (specified on the [`Run`](Run.html) file) with the [`read.exp.factors`](read.exp.factors.html) function within the
 [`run`](run.html) function. The `media.sur` input is created by sub-setting the [`Media`](Media.html) input file (read in
 with the [`read.media.file`](read.media.file.html) function within the [`run`](run.html) function).

# `p.round`: p.round

## Description


 p.round performs stochastic or probabilistic rounding of non-integer values.


## Usage

```r
p.round(x = NULL, q = NA)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```x```     |     Required     Default = none
```q```     |     Optional    Default = none

## Details


 The input "x" is a vector of values to be rounded.  Each value of x is rounded independently, either up or down.
 The fractional value of x is used to determine weights for rounding in each direction.  For example, if x=4.3, then it is
 rounded up to 5 with probability 0.3, else rounded down to 4 (with probability 0.7).   The p.round function always returns
 integer values, and does not introduce bias.  In the above example, if the argument were 4.3 a large number of times, then
 the returned values (all either 4 or 5) would average 4.3 with a small residual error which approaches zero as "n" gets large.


## Value


 A vector of the same length as the input "x", containing all integer values.

# `post.exposure`: post.exposure

## Description


 Resolves the fate of chemical after initial exposure has occurred. This involves parsing out the amount of chemical
 removed and amount ultimately contributing to the exposure dose for each person.


## Usage

```r
post.exposure(cb, cprops)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```cb```     |     A copy of the `base` data set output from the [`make.cbase`](make.cbase.html) function, with columns added for exposure variables.
```cprops```     |     The chemical properties required for SHEDS-HT. The default file (the [`Chem_props file`](Chem_props file.html) read in by the [`read.chem.props`](read.chem.props.html) function and modified before input into the current function) was prepared from publicly available databases using a custom program (not part of SHEDS-HT).  The default file contains 7 numerical inputs per chemical, and the required properties are molecular weight ( `MW` ), vapor pressure ( `VP.Pa` ), solubility ( `water.sol.mg.l` ), octanol-water partition coefficient ( `log.Kow` ), air decay rate ( `half.air.hr` ), decay rate on surfaces ( `half.sediment.hr` ), and permeability coefficient ( `Kp` ).

## Details


 This function resolves the fate of chemical after initial exposure has occurred.  The same function applies to all
 exposure scenarios.
 The dermal exposure is the most complicated, as there are five removal methods. All five are randomly sampled. While the sum
 of the five means is close to one, the sum of five random samples might not be, so these samples are treated as fractions of
 their sum. The `rem.bath` variable is either 0 or 1, so the bath removal term is either zero or the sampled bath removal
 efficiency. The `rem.brush` term is also simple. The handwashing ( `rem.wash` ) and hand-to-mouth
 ( `rem.hmouth` ) transfer terms are non-linear, because higher frequencies have less chemical available for removal on
 each repetition.  The algorithms in place were fitted to output from SHEDS-Multimedia, which were summed to daily totals.
 The final removal term is dermal absorption ( `rem.absorb` ). The base value is multiplied by the `Kp` factor from
 the `cprops` argument, and divided by the value for permethrin, as the values from SHEDS-Multimedia were based on a
 permethrin run.
 The five terms are evaluated separately for each person, as is their sum. Each is then converted to a fraction of the whole.
 The fractions may be quite different from one person to another. For one, perhaps 80% of the dermal loading is removed by
 a bath/shower, while for another person it is 0% because they did not take one.  For the latter person, other four removal
 terms are (on average) five times larger than for the former person, because together they account for 100% of the removal,
 instead of just 20%.
 The rest of the `post.exposure` function is mostly a matter of bookkeeping. The hand-to-mouth dermal removal term
 becomes an ingestion exposure term. Summing exposures across routes is dubious, in part because inhalation exposures use
 different units from the others, and because much of the dermal exposure never enters the body. In addition, summing dermal
 and ingestion exposures may double-count the hand-to-mouth term. However, intake dose may be summed. In SHEDS, "intake dose"
 is the sum of the inhaled dose (which is the amount of chemical entering the lungs in ug/day), the ingestion exposure (which
 is the amount entering the GI tract in ug/day), and the dermal absorption (the amount penetrating into or through the skin,
 so it cannot otherwise be removed, in ug/day).
 The "absorbed dose" is also calculated: for dermal it is the same as the intake dose, but for ingestion and
 inhalation there is another absorption factor, which was set on the exposure factors input file. An estimate of the
 chemical in urine (in ug/day) is made.  Both the intake dose and the absorbed dose are reported in both (ug/day) and in
 (mg/kg/day). Note that the latter requires the body weights of each individual. These cannot be obtained from the former
 just by knowing the average body weight in SHEDS.
 The above variables for each simulated person are written to the `fexp` object (the name stands for "final exposure").
 Each chemical writes over the previous `fexp` , so the data must first be summarized and written to an output file.


## Value


 fexp Absorbed dose and intake dose of a given chemical for each theoretical person being modeled for all
 exposure scenarios.

## Details


 This is the first real step in the modeling process. It first fills an array `q` with uniform random numbers,
 with ten columns because there are 10 random variables defined by this function. There number of rows correspond to the number
 of persons, capped at the `set.size` specified in the [`Run`](Run.html) input file (typically 5000).  Gender is selected
 from a discrete (binomial) distribution where the counts of males and females in the study age range determines the gender
 probabilities. Age is tabulated next, separately for each gender. The counts by year of age are chosen for the appropriate
 gender and used as selection weights. Season is assigned randomly (equal weights) using those specified in the [`Run`](Run.html) 
 input file. `Weekend` is set to one or zero, with a chance of 2/7 for the former.
 The next block of code assigns physiological variables. Weight is lognormal in SHEDS, so a normal is sampled first and then
 `exp()` is applied.  This means that the weight parameters refer to the properties of log(weight), which were fit by
 linear regression. The basal metabolic rate (bmr), is calculated by regression. A minimum bmr is set to prevent extreme cases
 from becoming zero or negative.  The alveolar breathing ventilation rate corresponding to bmr is also calculated. The SHEDS
 logic sets activities in each micro to be a multiple of these rates, with outdoor rates higher than indoor, and indoor rates
 higher than sleep rates. This calculated activities affect the inhaled dose. The skin surface area is calculated using
 regressions based on height and weight for 3 age ranges.
 The next step is to assign diaries.  Here, a FOR loop over n persons (n rows) is used to assign appropriate diet and activity
 diary pools to each person. An empirical distribution is created,  consisting of the list of diary numbers for each pool.
 The final step is to retrieve the actual data from the chosen activity and diet diaries, and the result becomes `pd` .


## Value


 pd A dataframe of "person-demographics": assigned demographic and physiological parameters for each theoretical
 person modeled in SHEDS.HT

# `trimzero`: Trimzero

## Description


 This function removes initial zeroes from CAS numbers.


## Usage

```r
trimzero(x, y)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```x```     |     aCAS number. Defult is none
```y```     |     A dummy argument This helps with the removal of the zeros inteh CAS number

## Details


 Each CAS number has three parts, separated by underscores.  The first part is up to seven digits, but optionally,
 leading zeroes are omitted.  For example, formaldehyde may be either "0000050_00_0" or "50_00_0". SHEDS needs to match
 CAS numbers across input files, and trimzero is used to ensure matching even when the input files follow different conventions.


## Value

# `unpack`: unpack

## Description


 unpack


## Usage

```r
unpack(filelist = "")
```


## Details


 This function is used when ShedsHT is run as an R package. Each time a new working directory is chosen, use unpack()
 to convert the R data objects into CSV files. Note that both /inputs and /output folders are needed under the chosen
 directory.Unpack() may be used with a list of object names, in which case just those objects are converted to CSV. This is
 useful when re-loading one or more defaults into a folder where some of the CSV files have changes, and should not be
 overwritten. A blank argument or empty list means that all the csv and TXT files in the R package are converted.

"Specs" contains a list of chemicals to be processed in the SHEDS run, and if any of these chemicals are missing from the "dt" table, then update.specs removes them from the list.  Otherwise, "specs" is not altered.


## Usage

```r
list(list("update"), list("specs"))(specs, dt)
```


# `vpos`: vpos

## Description


 This function locates an item in a list.


## Usage

```r
