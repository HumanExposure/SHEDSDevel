Description: The ShedsHT R package runs the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose
    Simulation-High Throughput screening model which estmates human exposure to a
    wide range of chemicals.The people in SHEDS-HT are simulated individuals who
    collectively form a representative sample of the target population, as chosen by
    the user. The model is cross-sectional, with just one simulated day (24 hours)
    for each simulated person, although the selected day is not necessarily the same
    from one person to another. SHEDS-HT is stochastic, which means that many inputs
    are sampled randomly from user-specified distributions that are intended to
    capture variability. In the SHEDS series of models, variability and uncertainty
    are typically handled by a two-stage Monte Carlo process, but SHEDS-HT currently
    has a single stage and does not directly estimate uncertainty.
